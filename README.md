# ttable

This is a program in C to generate a truth table on the console for a specified Boolean function.
Currently only works for 2 variables and limited set of Boolean functions.

## TODO
1. Read command file
2. Display truth table
3. Command line jazz

## Potential Ideas
1. Add custom user defined Boolean operators
